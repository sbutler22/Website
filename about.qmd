Hi!

My name is Sam and I'm from Philadelphia. I am currently a senior at Pomona College studying math on the statistics track. I love working with data and especially enjoy making visualizations, and this site provides a neat little place to bring them together.

Outside of statistics, I love to spend time outdoors, rock climb, hike, and bike. I am also the captain of my collegiate track and field team, and when I'm not in Estella (our math building) I am usually down at the track. Go hens!
