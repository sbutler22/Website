This research was done in collaboration with Phineus Choi, Thomas Matheis, and Mira Terdiman under the advisement of Jo Hardin, in the summer and fall of 2025. The paper below has been submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

# Summary

The R package **sicegar** aims to quantify time-intensity data by using sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves. The method was originally developed in the context of single-cell viral growth analysis (for details, see @caglar2018), and the package name stands for "SIngle CEll Growth Analysis in R". In addition to categorizing the best model fit, **sicegar** returns parameter estimates for each of the model fits, providing important information to researchers.

The sigmoidal function is given as $I(x)$, with parameters estimated using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [@levenberg1944;@marquardt1963]. $h_0$ represents the lower asymptote (as $x$ approaches negative infinity). $t_1$ is the onset time (the inflection point) and the midpoint between 
$h_0$ and $h_1$. $a$ determines the magnitude of the slope of the sigmoidal curve. $h_1$ is the upper asymptote (as $x$ approaches positive infinity). The parameters describing the sigmoidal curve in $I(x)$ are graphically represented in **Figure 1**.


$I(x) = h_0 + \frac{h_1-h_0}{1 + e^{-a(x - t_1)}}$

A similar, but slightly more complicated, formula for the double-sigmoidal function is also used for parameter estimation in sicegar. In the original implementation of sicegar, the parameter $h_0$ is set to zero for both the sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal models.

**sicegar**'s parameter estimation allows users to extract key model parameters, including the onset time of RNA expression in specific genes [@caglar2018]. Onset time is defined as the time when the half-maximal abundance of RNA is reached in the cell. For example, @Adams uses **sicegar** to investigate the onset time of RNA expression from genes in E. coli undergoing stress. Accurate estimates of $t_1$ are crucial for understanding transriptional timing of genes. However, @Adams observed limitations in **sicegar**'s fits, which motivated the package improvements proposed in our paper.

We have substantially modified **sicegar** (our work is currently implemented on CRAN) to improve the parameter estimates for both sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal models. Our primary update to the **sicegar** package is the inclusion and estimation of an additional parameter, $h_0$, the lower asymptote of both the sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves, which had previously been set equal to zero. Based on simulated data, the free estimation of $h_0$ provides both a better overall model fit (lower SSE) and more accurate parameter estimates than when $h_0$ is forced to be equal to zero.

# Statement of Need

@caglar2018 discuss **sicegar**'s ability to correctly identify sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves on simulated data.
They report, "Overall, we can conclude that our algorithm results in reliable fits, that it fails gradually with increasing noise levels, and that it is conservative in assessing whether it has correctly identified a sigmoidal or double-sigmoidal curve or not."
The focus of their results is on whether **sicegar** is able to correctly identify sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves on simulated data, not on whether it is able to accurately report parameter estimations.
Though they acknowledge **sicegar**'s ability to estimate parameters associated with sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves, they do not report on the accuracy of the parameter estimates.


In dozens of papers that use **sicegar** for modeling time-intensity data, researchers are interested in extracting specific parameter estimates, e.g., midpoints and slopes, as the parameter values represent biologically meaningful information.
@Adams extracted midpoint values ($t_1$) to investigate onset time of RNA expression in genes in *E. coli* undergoing stress.
@wittemeier used **sicegar** to estimate molar carbon assimilation. 
They used **sicegar**'s estimation of maximum slope in sigmoidal curves to understand maximum assimilation rate, and midpoints ($t_1$) in sigmoidal curves to extract the point at which maximum assimilation is reached. 
@rajarathinam also used **sicegar** to analyze carbon assimilation and to extract estimations of maximum slope.
Our addition of $h_0$ to the set of estimated parameters greatly improves the package's ability to provide accurate parameter estimations.
Through simulations, with varying levels of noise, generating parameters, and both sigmoidal and double sigmoidal curves, we were able to accurately estimate all parameter estimates, even when the lower asymptote is not zero.
Though the categorization of the model as sigmoidal or double-sigmoidal is hugely important, it is not the only important aspect of the **sicegar** modeling.
Our updated implementation, which includes the estimation of the lower asymptote, is prevailingly important, and thus our adjustments fit the needs of current research. 

As previously mentioned, **sicegar** fits time-intensity data to single and double sigmoid curves, which allows users to extract key parameters including the onset time of RNA expression in specific genes [@caglar2018]. 
To better contextualize the relevance of sigmoid parameters to onset time, we can map the parameters described in equation $I(x)$ to a plot of a typical single-sigmoid function:


# Features 

### Core Functions

`fitAndCategorize`, the umbrella function in **sicegar**, takes time-intensity data as an argument and runs through a series of nested functions.
The process is outlined in **Figure 1**.
First, the data are normalized in the function `normalizeData` (1).
Then they are passed through `multipleFitFunction` (2) which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [@levenberg1944;@marquardt1963] to fit both sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal curves to the data, (3), (4).
Additional parameters are then added to the output vector in `parameterCalculations` to prepare the model to be plotted.
The user decides whether to allow the function to estimate $h_0$ using the argument `use_h0 = TRUE` in `fitAndCategorize`. 
If `use_h0` is set to `FALSE` (the default), the algorithm will run **sicegar** as it was originally written, with $h_0$ fixed at zero.
If they choose to allow the function to estimate $h_0$, it will follow the same function flow, except that each function will account for the estimation of $h_0$.

### Novel Contributions

Each function in **sicegar** was rewritten to include the parameter $h_0$ in addition to a some small technical changes to the functions. 
Our new version is outlined in the right-hand branch of **Figure 1**.

### Example
To demonstrate the difference between the functionality when $h_0 = 0$ versus when $h_0$ is freely estimated, we present a small simulation based on sigmoidal data. The parameters in our simulation are $h_0=2$, $h_1=4$, $a=1$, and $t_1=12$. At each of nine time points on the x-axis, we have five of replicates around the sigmoidal model with normal noise (centered at 0, standard deviation of 3).

For each of 200 simulated sigmoidal datasets, **Figure 3** shows the parameter estimates for each of the four parameters given in $I(x)$, see **Figure 1**. The red vertical line indicates the value of the parameter used for data generation. It should be noted that allowing $h_0$ to be freely estimated provides both more accurate parameter estimations — notably for $t_1$ — and better categorizations of the model (as "sigmoidal" rather than "ambiguous"). Similar results occur when the package is run on simulated data with more noise, as well as on data simulated from the double-sigmoidal model. Our simulation does not prove that estimating $h_0$ freely is always preferable, but it does indicate that there are circumstances in which estimating $h_0$ is important for full approximation of the model.
